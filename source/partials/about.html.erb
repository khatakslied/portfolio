    <p>I'm a full-stack web developer, living in Osaka. My entry to programming was through front-end web design, but I quickly realised my enjoyment for algorithmic problem-solving as soon as I ran into Javascript. I have a background in furniture design and production, so I'm used to (and revel in) the demands of combining fancifulness (front-end) with practicality (back-end). Currently, I'm focusing on building applications in <strong>Rails</strong>, <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>.</p>
